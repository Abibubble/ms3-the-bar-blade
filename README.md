[Here is a link to the final project](https://ms3-the-bar-blade.herokuapp.com/homepage)

This is a cocktail recipe site, built for bartenders, by bartenders. It's a site where users can sign in, find cocktails, add their own cocktails, and edit or delete old cocktail recipes. It is designed to be responsive on a wide range of devices, whilst also being easy to navigate through.

## User Experience (UX)
### Initial Discussion
I wanted to create a website linked to a database, which allows users to login, add their own cocktails, or just search and find previously added cocktails. As an ex-bartender myself, this was something I always wanted but couldn't find online.

### User Stories
#### First Time Visitor Goals
* To be able to easily navigate the site.
* It should be easy to understand what to do.
* It should be easy to register for an account.
* It should be easy to search for a specific cocktail.

#### Returning Visitor Goals
* It should be easy to add, edit and delete the user's cocktails.
* It should be easy to see the cocktails the user has added.
* The user's password should be stored securely.
* It should be easy to search for a specific cocktail.

#### Frequent Visitor Goals
* It should be easy to search for a specific cocktail.
* Navigation should be intuitive, with no need to use the browser's back button.

#### Admin Goals
* Other users shouldn't be able to edit or delete the user's cocktails.
* A user shouldn't be able to brute force their way into the restricted pages.
* Be able to edit or delete any recipe as an admin.

### Project Goals
* This project has the goal of demonstrating my understanding of maintaining a database attached to a website, with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) functionality.

---
## Design
### Color Scheme
* I decided on a very simple theme of purple and black for my color scheme.
* I didn't want to distract from the content of the site, hence choosing two main colours.
* I have used 3 different shades of purple to provide some contrast on the site.
* All text is white, which allows the text to be easily visible on all backgrounds.
* I have used other colors on buttons only:
    * I have used red only for the delete buttons, to convey the button is a destructive thing.
    * I have used green only for the cancel button on the delete modals, to signify a return to safety for the user.
    * I have used blue only for the edit buttons, to show that it's a creative thing.

![Color Scheme](static/docs/img/colors.png)

### Typography
* I have used a barcode-style font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), called [Libre Barcode 128 Text](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Barcode+128+Text), to form the logo. This has the fallback font of sans-serif.

![Libre Barcode 128 Text font](static/docs/img/libre-font.png)

* I have used a cursive font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), called [Dancing Script](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dancing+Script), to link with the theme of an elegant cocktail bar. This has the fallback font of cursive.

![Dancing Script font](static/docs/img/dancing-font.png)

* The basic font-family of Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif has been used for the rest of the text, so as to not distract the user from the content of the site. This also comes with the bonus that it's standard with HTML, so it should render on any browser and any device.

![Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif font](static/docs/img/standard-font.png)

### Imagery
* The images used in this project are all pictures of cocktails, to match the recipes.
* Icons are used where suitable to allow users to easily understand at a glance what is intended.
* Unfortunately there isn't much control about what images users upload. If any inappropriate images are added, the any admin user has the ability to edit the image.

### Wireframes
[Here are the wireframes for desktop, mobile and tablet for this project](static/docs/wireframes.pdf).

### Features
* Create, Edit and Delete a cocktail recipe.

* A link to [Drink Aware](https://www.drinkaware.co.uk/) in the footer, for anyone struggling with alcohol use.

![Drink Aware link](static/docs/img/drink-aware.png)

### Future Features
* Email verification before a user can add a cocktail.
* Enter user's password to delete user account.
* Create an 'Add to Favourites' so users can store their favourite cocktail recipes.
* When registering a new account, add ability to view the password that was typed in before submitting.

### Audio
* No audio is used in this project.

### Navigation bar
The navigation bar changes depending on user status and screen size:

| Nav Link | Logged Out | Logged In (User) | Logged In (Admin) |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|
| Logo (Homepage) | &#9989; | &#9989; | &#9989; |

## Database Design
MongoDB was used to store data for this site in a database. The data has been set out in three collections, which are described below:

| Users |    |
|-------|-----|
| _id | ObjectId |
| username | string |
| password | string |

| Recipes |    |    |
|---|---|---|
| _id | ObjectId |    |
| category_id | ObjectId | categories._id |
| recipe_name | string |    |
| recipe_list | array |    |
| method | string |    |
| recipe_img | string |    |
| recipe_alt | string |    |
| user_id | ObjectId | users._id |

| Categories |    |    |
|---|---|---|
| _id | ObjectId |    |
| category_name | string |    |

## Deployment
### Initial Deployment
This site was deployed to Heroku by following these steps:

1. Heroku needs to be told what the requirements are for this project, so go into your GitPod terminal, and create files to explain the requirements by using the following commands:
    * `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
    * `echo web: python run.py > Procfile` - Ensure there is no blank line after the contents of this file
2. Push these changes to your repository.
3. Ensure you have a .gitignore file in your repository, and if not, create one.
4. Add `env.py` and `__pycache__/` into your .gitignore file, and save the file. This is to avoid any sensitive information being added into your repository.
5. Create an env.py file, and add the following information to it, updating the '## x ##' values with your own values:

``` python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", " ##YOUR UNIQUE SECRET KEY## ")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", " ##YOUR UNIQUE URI FROM MONGODB## ")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DB", " ##YOUR DATABASE NAME## ")
```

6. Login or sign up to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).
7. Select 'Create New App' from your dashboard.
8. Choose a unique app name, and select the region closest to you, before clicking 'Create App'.
9. Go to the 'Deploy' tab, find 'Deployment Method' and select 'GitHub'.
10. Search to find your GitHub repository, and click 'Connect'. Don't enable automatic deployment yet, as this can cause errors.
11. Go to the 'Settings' tab, find 'Config Vars', and click 'Reveal Config Vars'.
12. Enter key value pairs that match those in your env.py file as shown above.
13. Go to the 'Deploy' tab, and click 'Enable Automatic Deployment'.
14. In 'Manual Deploy', choose which branch you'd like to deploy from (I chose 'master' branch, this is also known as 'main').
15. Click 'Deploy Branch'.
16. Once the app has finished building, click 'Open App' to open your site.

## Testing
### W3C Validator
The W3C Markup Validator, W3C CSS Validator, JSHint were used to validate the project to ensure there were no syntax errors within the site.

1. W3C Markup Validator
    * [HTML Results](LINK)

2. W3C CSS Validator
    * [CSS Results](LINK)
    * There is only one error appearing, which is from the Materialize CSS file.
    * There are several warnings, mostly from the Materialize CSS file, but also three related to my purple variables. As these variables are acceptable CSS syntax, I've considered them to be not an error.

3. JSHint
    * [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

### Testing User Stories
#### First Time Visitor Goals
##### To be able to easily navigate the site.
* The navigation bar is clearly visible on all pages.
* The navigation bar is fixed to the top of the screen, so even when the user scrolls, they can still see the navigation bar.

##### It should be easy to understand what to do.
* Everything is clearly laid out.
* All buttons decribe what they're for in simple terms.
* Icons are used to help convey meaning.

##### It should be easy to register for an account.
* The register button is clear to see on the navigation bar, and it only requires a username, a password, and a confirmation of that password to register an account.

##### It should be easy to search for a specific cocktail.
* The search bar is displayed prominently on the homepage for all users, whether logged in or not.

#### Returning Visitor Goals
##### It should be easy to add, edit and delete the user's cocktails.
* Every cocktail that a user has added is displayed on their profile.
* Each cocktail listing has it's own edit and delete buttons.
* There is a link to add a cocktail on the navigation bar, which is available on every page.
* If the user hasn't added any cocktails, their profile instead prompts them to add one, with a helpful button to aid them.

##### It should be easy to see the cocktails the user has added.
* Every cocktail that a user has added is displayed on their profile.

##### The user's password should be stored securely.
* Werkzeug's password hashing methods have been used to store all user's passwords in a secure and safe way.

##### It should be easy to search for a specific cocktail.
* The search bar is displayed prominently on the homepage for all users, whether logged in or not.

#### Frequent Visitor Goals
##### It should be easy to search for a specific cocktail.
* The search bar is displayed prominently on the homepage for all users, whether logged in or not.

##### Navigation should be intuitive, with no need to use the browser's back button.
* The navigation bar is constantly visible across the top of the site, whether that be the full navigation bar or the condensed burger icon menu bar on smaller screen sizes.

#### Admin Goals
##### Other users shouldn't be able to edit or delete the user's cocktails.
* Edit and delete buttons are only shown for cocktails on the user's profile.
* The only cocktails shown on the user's profile are the ones created by them.

##### A user shouldn't be able to brute force their way into the restricted pages.
* 

##### Be able to edit or delete any recipe as an admin.
* 

### Full Testing

### Solved Bugs
1. When I added the confirm deletion modal into categories.html, it wasn't taking the category I'd clicked on to delete, it was just deleting the first category in the list.
    * I looked through my code on Google DevTools and saw that, as my delete button was part of a for loop that was populating categories, it was also duplicating the ID of the modal.
    * This meant that when it came to deleting, it didn't know which one of those IDs I actually wanted to delete.
    * I then added in the `category._id`, so I could have an individual ID for each category.
    * This solved the bug, and also fixed the issue that W3C HTML validator brought up about repeated IDs.
2. When the user clicked the 'delete' or 'edit' buttons on their profile cocktails, the collapsible would expand as well as the button's action.
    * I discovered that, as the buttons were inside the collapsible-header Materialize class, they were being treated as clickable too.
    * I attempted to move them to the right of the headers, but this resulted in the buttons not connecting to their cocktail recipes.
    * Instead, I moved them into the expanded section, so now the user can click on the header to expand, and depending on the contents of the recipe, can then decide to delete or edit.
    * This makes more sense than where I had them before, as the user won't know if they want to edit or delete a recipe until they've looked at it.

### Known Bugs
* ANY BUGS LEFT IN THE CODE AFTER FINAL DEPLOYMENT, FOR FIXING IN FUTURE RELEASES

### Lighthouse
I tested my website using DevTools Lighthouse feature, and got these results:

#### Desktop

#### Accessibility:
* EXPLAIN SCORE AND HOW I IMPROVED IT IF NECESSARY
* All images have alt text, including a request for users to add alt text for their own images so the site stays fully accessible.
* All icons have titles where text isn't otherwise present to explain their use.
* All colors are WCAG AA compliant. The majority are AAA compliant, except for the Delete and Edit buttons.
