Cocktail recipe site

Project Example Idea 1
Create an online cocktail recipe site

External user’s goal:
Find and share recipes

Site owner's goal:
Gain a collection of cocktails

Potential features to include:
Create a web application that allows users to store and easily access cocktail recipes. Recipes would include fields such as ingredients, preparation steps, required tools, cuisine, etc.

Create the backend code and frontend form(s) to allow users to add new recipes to the site, edit them and delete them.

Create the backend and frontend functionality for users to locate recipes based on the recipe's fields. You may choose to create a full search functionality, or just a directory of recipes.

Provide results in a manner that is visually appealing and user friendly.

Advanced potential feature (nice-to-have)
Build upon the required tools field to promote your brand of kitchen tools (e.g. oven, pressure cooker, etc…).

Create a dashboard to provide some statistics about all the recipes.

## Deployment
### Initial Deployment
This site was deployed to GitHub Pages by following these steps:
1. Login or Sign Up to [GitHub](www.github.com).
2. Create a new repository named "REPO".
3. Once created, click on "Settings" on the navigation bar under the repository title.
4. Scroll down to "GitHub Pages".
5. Under "Source", choose which branch to deploy. I chose "master", but this is sometimes shown as "main".
6. Choose which folder to deploy from, usually "/root".
7. Click "Save", then wait for it to be deployed. It can take some time for the page to be fully deployed.
8. Your URL will be displayed above "Source".

### How to Fork it

2. On GitHub, go to [Abibubble/REPO](https://github.com/Abibubble/REPO).
3. In the top right, click "Fork".

### How to Clone it
1. Login or Sign Up to [GitHub](www.github.com).
2. Fork the repository Abibubble/REPO using the steps above in [How to Fork it](#how-to-fork-it).
3. Above the file list, click "Code".
4. Choose if you want to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI, then click the copy button to the right.
5. Open Git Bash.
6. Change the directory to where you want your clone to go.
7. Type git clone and then paste the URL you copied in step 4.
8. Press Enter to create your clone.

### Making a Local Clone
1. Log in to [GitHub](www.github.com) and locate the [Repository](https://github.com/Abibubble/REPO) for this site.
2. Under the repository name, above the list of files, click "Code".
3. Here you can either Clone or Download the repository.
4. You should clone the repository using HTTPS, clicking on the icon to copy the link.
5. Open Git Bash.
6. Change the current working directory to the new location, where you want the cloned directory to be.
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL that was copied in Step 4.
7. Press Enter, and your local clone will be created.
