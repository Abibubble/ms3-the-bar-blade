[Here is a link to the final project](https://ms3-the-bar-blade.herokuapp.com/homepage)

This is a cocktail recipe site, built for bartenders, by bartenders. It's a site where users can sign in, find cocktails, add their own cocktails, and edit or delete old cocktail recipes. It is designed to be responsive on a wide range of devices, whilst also being easy to navigate through.

## User Experience (UX)
### Initial Discussion
I wanted to create a website linked to a database, which allows users to login, add their own cocktails, or just search and find previously added cocktails. As an ex-bartender myself, this was something I always wanted but couldn't find online.

### User Stories
#### First Time Visitor Goals
* To be able to easily navigate the site.
* It should be easy to understand what to do.
* It should be easy to register for an account.

#### Returning Visitor Goals
* It should be easy to add, edit and delete the user's cocktails.
* It should be easy to see the cocktails the user has added.
* The user's password should be stored securely.

#### Frequent Visitor Goals
* Other users shouldn't be able to edit or delete the user's cocktails.
* A user shouldn't be able to brute force their way into the restricted pages.

### Project Goals
* This project has the goal of demonstrating my understanding of maintaining a database attached to a website, with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) functionality.

---
## Design
### Color Scheme
* I decided on a very simple theme of purple and black for my color scheme.
* I didn't want to distract from the content of the site, hence choosing two main colours.
* I have used 3 different shades of purple to provide some contrast.
* All text is white, which allows the text to be easily visible on all backgrounds.
* I have used red only for the delete buttons, to convey the button is a destructive thing.
![Color Scheme](static/docs/colors.png)

### Typography
* I have used a barcode-style font for the logo from Google Fonts, called Libre Barcode 128 Text. This has the fallback font of sans-serif.
* I have used a cursive font from Google Fonts, called Dancing Script, to link with the theme of an elegant cocktail bar. This has the fallback font of cursive.
* The basic font-family of Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif has been used for the rest of the text, so as to not distract the user from the content of the site. This also comes with the bonus that it's standard with HTML, so it should render on any browser and any device.

### Imagery
* Cocktail images
* Icons

### Wireframes
[Here are the wireframes for desktop, mobile and tablet for this project](static/docs/wireframes.pdf).

### Features
* WHAT FEATURES ARE ONE THE SITE, LIKE SCOREBOARD, FUNCTIONS, SCROLLING ALERT BAR, ETC.

### Audio
* No audio is used in this project.

2. Create a new repository named "ms3-the-bar-blade".
3. Once created, click on "Settings" on the navigation bar under the repository title.
4. Scroll down to "GitHub Pages".
5. Under "Source", choose which branch to deploy. I chose "master", but this is sometimes shown as "main".
6. Choose which folder to deploy from, usually "/root".
7. Click "Save", then wait for it to be deployed. It can take some time for the page to be fully deployed.
8. Your URL will be displayed above "Source".

### How to Fork it

2. On GitHub, go to [Abibubble/ms3-the-bar-blade](https://github.com/Abibubble/ms3-the-bar-blade).
3. In the top right, click "Fork".

### How to Clone it
1. Login or Sign Up to [GitHub](www.github.com).
2. Fork the repository Abibubble/ms3-the-bar-blade using the steps above in [How to Fork it](#how-to-fork-it).
3. Above the file list, click "Code".
4. Choose if you want to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI, then click the copy button to the right.
5. Open Git Bash.
6. Change the directory to where you want your clone to go.
7. Type git clone and then paste the URL you copied in step 4.
8. Press Enter to create your clone.

### Making a Local Clone
1. Log in to [GitHub](www.github.com) and locate the [Repository](https://github.com/Abibubble/ms3-the-bar-blade) for this site.
2. Under the repository name, above the list of files, click "Code".
3. Here you can either Clone or Download the repository.
4. You should clone the repository using HTTPS, clicking on the icon to copy the link.
5. Open Git Bash.
6. Change the current working directory to the new location, where you want the cloned directory to be.
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL that was copied in Step 4.
7. Press Enter, and your local clone will be created.

For a more detailed version of these steps, go to the [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-to-github-desktop) page on this topic.

### Solved Bugs
1. When I added the confirm deletion modal into categories.html, it wasn't taking the category I'd clicked on to delete, it was just deleting the first category in the list.
    * I looked through my code on Google DevTools and saw that, as my delete button was part of a for loop that was populating categories, it was also duplicating the ID of the modal.
    * This meant that when it came to deleting, it didn't know which one of those IDs I actually wanted to delete.
    * I then added in the ```category._id```, so I could have an individual ID for each category.
    * This solved the bug, and also fixed the issue that W3C HTML validator brought up about repeated IDs.

### Known Bugs
* ANY BUGS LEFT IN THE CODE AFTER FINAL DEPLOYMENT, FOR FIXING IN FUTURE RELEASES

### Lighthouse
